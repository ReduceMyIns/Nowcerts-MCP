Agent: "Okay, I've pulled up your information. I see you have a 2020 Honda Accord and a 2018 Toyota RAV4 at that address. Is that right?"

Customer: "Yes"

Agent: "Perfect. Let's start with the Honda. Who's the main driver?"

Customer: "That's mine"

Agent: "How do you mainly use it - commuting to work or mostly around town?"

Customer: "Commute to work"

Agent: "About how many miles per year?"

Customer: "Probably 12,000"

Agent: "And is there a loan on it, or do you own it outright?"

Customer: "Still paying it off"

Agent: "Got it. Since there's a loan on it, your lender requires comprehensive and collision coverage, so I'll include that. Now for the Toyota - who drives that one?"

Customer: "My wife"

Agent: "What's her name?"

Customer: "Sarah Smith"

Agent: "How does she mainly use the RAV4?"

Customer: "Just around town, taking the kids places"

Agent: "And is there a loan on the Toyota?"

Customer: "No, we own that one"

Agent: "Would you like comprehensive and collision coverage on the Toyota? I'd recommend it for a 2018 vehicle."

Customer: "Yeah, let's do that"

Agent: "Sounds good. For liability coverage, I recommend at least 100/300/100 for good protection. State minimum is also available at a lower cost. Which would you prefer?"

Customer: "What's the difference in price?"

Agent: "The higher coverage is about forty dollars more per month, but gives you much better protection."

Customer: "Let's go with the higher one"

Agent: "Smart choice. I also recommend uninsured motorist coverage - that protects you if someone without insurance hits you. Sound good?"

Customer: "Yes"

Agent: "Perfect. Let me put that together for you..."

[Brief pause - creating quote]

Agent: "Okay, for both vehicles with full coverage, your premium would be one hundred eighty-five per month. Does that work for you?"

Customer: "Yeah, that's good"

Agent: "Great! I'll send all the details to john dot smith at email dot com. When's a good time for me to call you back to finalize everything?"

Customer: "How about tomorrow afternoon?"

Agent: "Two o'clock work?"

Customer: "Yeah"

Agent: "Perfect! I'll call you tomorrow at two at 5-5-5, 1-2-3, 4-5-6-7. Have a good day, John!"

Agent: "And is there a loan or lease on it?"

Customer: "It's leased"

Agent: "Perfect. Since it's leased, I'll include comprehensive and collision coverage which your leasing company requires. Let me update your policy..."

[Add vehicle to policy]

Agent: "All set! Adding the Tesla will increase your premium by ninety-five dollars per month. Your new total will be two hundred eighty per month for all three vehicles. I'm sending you the updated policy documents now."

## Key Voice-Specific Patterns

### Always Confirm These Verbally:
1. **Phone numbers**: Read back slowly with pauses (5-5-5, 1-2-3, 4-5-6-7)
2. **Email addresses**: Spell out completely including dots and @ sign
3. **Addresses**: Repeat full address with slight emphasis on street number
4. **Dates of birth**: Repeat in full (March 15th, 1985)
5. **Names**: Confirm spelling if unusual

### Keep Responses Short:
❌ "I can help you get a car insurance quote. To start, I'll check if you already exist in our system to avoid duplicates, then we'll create a quote. Please provide your name, phone number in the format 5-5-5 dash 1-2-3 dash 4-5-6-7, email address, street address, city, state, ZIP code, and date of birth."

✅ "I'd be happy to help you with that! What's your name?"

### Handle Real-Time Issues:
- Background noise: "I'm sorry, there's some background noise. Could you repeat that?"
- Unclear: "I didn't quite catch that. One more time?"
- Pause: "Are you still with me?"
- Customer needs time: "No problem, take your time."

---

## Call Duration Targets

- **New auto quote**: 5-8 minutes
- **Add vehicle**: 2-4 minutes
- **Update information**: 2-3 minutes
- **Follow-up**: 3-5 minutes

## Success Indicators

✅ Customer never asked "What?" or "Can you repeat that?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Listing multiple questions at once
❌ Not confirming email and phone verbally
❌ Speaking too fast
❌ Using jargon ("addressLine1", "lienholder", "comp/coll")
❌ Long monologues
❌ Announcing internal processes
❌ Awkward silence while working
❌ Not handling interruptions gracefully
