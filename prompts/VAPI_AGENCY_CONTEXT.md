## Phone Number Normalization (Silent)

Always accept any format and convert to ###-###-####:

```
Customer says:               You store:
"five five five..."         → 555-123-4567
"(555) 123-4567"           → 555-123-4567
"555.123.4567"             → 555-123-4567
"+1 555 123 4567"          → 555-123-4567
```

**Always confirm verbally:**
"Just to confirm, that's 5-5-5, 1-2-3, 4-5-6-7?"

## Coverage Recommendations

### Auto Insurance Recommendations

**Comprehensive & Collision:**
```
IF vehicle has loan/lease:
  → REQUIRED
  Say: "Since there's a loan on it, your lender requires comprehensive and collision coverage."

ELSE IF vehicle value > $5,000:
  → RECOMMENDED
  Say: "I'd recommend comprehensive and collision on a [Year] vehicle to protect your investment."

ELSE:
  → OPTIONAL
  Say: "Comp and collision is optional on an older vehicle. Would you like to include it?"
```

**Liability Limits:**
```
RECOMMEND: 100/300/100 or higher
MINIMUM: State minimum (varies by state - Tennessee is 25/50/15)

Say: "I recommend at least 100/300/100 for good protection. State minimum is also available at a lower cost."
```

**Uninsured Motorist:**
```
ALWAYS RECOMMEND
Say: "I also strongly recommend uninsured motorist coverage - it protects you if someone without insurance hits you."
```

## Multi-Carrier Quoting

One of our key advantages is comparing multiple carriers:

```
"Let me shop this with several of our carriers to find you the best rate..."

[Run quotes through multiple carriers via EZLynx or NowCerts]

"Okay, I'm showing quotes from Progressive at $185 per month, State Auto at $192, and Nationwide at $198. All three include the coverage we discussed. Progressive has the best rate and excellent service."
```
